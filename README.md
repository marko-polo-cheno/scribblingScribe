# Scribbling Scribe
### Tracking my own cultivation

New rule: skipping saturdays

Link to my [church](https://tjc.org/).

<details>

<span style="font-size: 1.5em;">Bible</span>
</summary>

*Man shall not live by bread alone*...

I will:
 - write one section of the NKJV Bible every day
 - listen to that section in Chinese
 - write down the outline

Kinda too lazy to make an automated progress bar for now.  
Will consider once things are in better shape using [this](./bible_metadata.csv).

*I will bless the Lord at all times*...

I never learned to play all 525 hymns on the piano with sincerety. When I do, I'll add it to a completion list.  
Eventually, I can use this CSV can train a digital assistant in suggesting hymns for any topic.

<span style="font-size: 1.5em;">Prayer</span>
</summary>

*Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace*...

I will:
 - track if I prayed in the morning and night
 - write one thing I'm thankful for
 - write one prayer request
 - write the biggest oof of the day

[Prayer Log](./prayer_log.csv)

It'd be interesting to see how things change over time, or don't change over time.
